Mini Games Collection

This repository contains a collection of small games built using Python. These games serve as a fun way to practice programming concepts while creating interactive experiences.

Games Included

1. GuessBot (Two Versions)

GuessBot: The computer selects a random number, and the user tries to guess it. It simply tells if the guess is correct and reveals the number.

GuessBot V2 (Improved): The user has multiple attempts to guess the number. The game tracks consecutive correct guesses and interacts with the user based on their performance (e.g., rewarding quick guesses).

2. OddOrEven Game

A simple game where the user and the computer choose numbers, and the program determines whether the sum is odd or even.

3. Rock, Scissor, Paper

The classic game where the user plays against the computer by choosing Rock, Scissors, or Paper. The program determines the winner based on standard game rules.

How to Play

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/K4-Ko/mini-games.git

Navigate to the game directory and run the Python scripts:

python GuessBot.py
python GuessBotV2.py
python OddOrEven.py
python RockScissorPaper.py

Requirements

Python 3.x

No additional libraries are required; the games run using Python's built-in features.

Purpose

This project is designed for fun and learning. It helps practice Python fundamentals, logic building, and user interaction through simple games.
