# Mini Games Collection

This repository contains a collection of small games built using Python. These games serve as a fun way to practice programming concepts while creating interactive experiences.

## Games Included

### 1. GuessBot (Two Versions)
- **GuessBot:** The computer selects a random number, and the user tries to guess it. It simply tells if the guess is correct and reveals the number.
- **GuessBot V2 (Improved):** The user has multiple attempts to guess the number. The game tracks consecutive correct guesses and interacts with the user based on their performance (e.g., rewarding quick guesses).

### 2. OddOrEven Game
- A simple game where the user and the computer choose numbers, and the program determines whether the sum is odd or even.

### 3. Rock, Scissor, Paper
- The classic game where the user plays against the computer by choosing Rock, Scissors, or Paper. The program determines the winner based on standard game rules.

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/K4-Ko/Studying-Python.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the Mini Games directory and run the Python scripts:
   ```bash
   cd Studying-Python/Mini\ Games
   python GuessBot.py
   python GuessBotV2.py
   python OddOrEven.py
   python RockScissorPaper.py
   ```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No additional libraries are required; the games run using Python's built-in features.

## Purpose
This project is designed for fun and learning. It helps practice Python fundamentals, logic building, and user interaction through simple games.

## Contributions
Feel free to contribute by improving the games or adding new ones!
